Some suggestions for accepting other data types besides an int: 
    1. Change the Node class to accept that specific data type (or generic object)
    2. Change deserializeHelper in the TreeSerializer class to take the serialized string and return that to desired data type
        - Would need more time to research and understand how to do this
